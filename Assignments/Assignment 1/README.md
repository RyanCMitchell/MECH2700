The Python script has been created for ease of use, to make your life as easy
as possible. There is only 1 file that contains all of the functions and
computations.

Open Assignment1.py and run the module. Text will print once the script has
loaded. Once loaded there are 3 functions that can be run. All the functions
will display a plot of the physical environment / setting as well as the
trajectory of the bread being fired. Once the plot has been closed, text
will be printed providing relevant details such as landing location and/or
optimal firing velocity and angle.

The 3 functions are:
1 - guess(velocity, thetaDeg, timeStep=0.01)
2 - noDrag(velocity, thetaDeg, timeStep=0.01)
3 - optimal(timeStep=0.01)
and can be called from the command prompt once loaded.
